Logitech Wheel Helper allows you to change global settings that still work but are no longer visible in the modern Logitech drivers for devices like the G29 and G920.

You can easily change global force feedback settings that adjust to all games like:
- Overall effects strength
- Spring effect strength
- Damper effect strength

These settings were always available for the G25 and G27 but Logitech decided to hide those settings for the G29 and G920.

Tested with drivers LGS 9.02.65 and LGHUB 2020.1.31155.
